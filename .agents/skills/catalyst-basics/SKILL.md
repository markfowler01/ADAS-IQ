> **⚠️ PRE-FLIGHT CHECK:** Before creating any project files, confirm that `.catalystrc` and
> `catalyst.json` exist in the project directory. If they don't:
> 1. Use MCP (`CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Organizations` → `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Projects`) to get the org ID and project ID.
> 2. Run: `catalyst init --org <orgId> -p <projectId> -ni`
> 3. **Never ask the user to run `catalyst init` interactively. Never create these files manually** — they are CLI-generated and must come from the CLI.

## How It Works

1. **MCP check first** — Before reading any local files, look for `CatalystbyZoho_*` tools. If available, use MCP to get org ID, project ID, and all resource IDs instead of asking the user.
2. **Account alignment check — do this before `catalyst init`** — MCP and CLI can be authenticated as different accounts. Before running `catalyst init --org <id>`, verify they match:
   ```bash
   catalyst whoami
   ```
   Compare the org name shown to the result of `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Organizations`. If they differ, run `catalyst login --force` to re-authenticate the CLI before proceeding.
3. **New to Catalyst?** — If the user is setting up Catalyst for the first time or asking "how do I start", load `references/quick-start.md` for the full walkthrough.
4. **Console navigation** — If the user asks how to find IDs, create tables, set permissions, or configure CORS in the console, load `references/console-ui-guide.md`.
5. **Pre-flight** — Confirm `.catalystrc` and `catalyst.json` exist. If missing, use MCP to get org/project IDs and run `catalyst init --org <orgId> -p <projectId> -ni`. Never use interactive `catalyst init`.
6. **Project structure** — Load `references/project-basics.md` for directory layout, `catalyst.json`, IDs, and dev-to-prod checklist.
7. **CLI questions** — Load `references/cli.md` for the exact command, flags, and safety rules.
8. **Answer** — Provide the specific ID path or CLI command needed. Never ask the user to manually look up IDs when MCP is connected.

## Triggers

Use this skill for: "how do I start a Catalyst project", "what is .catalystrc", "where do I find my Table ID / ZAID / Segment ID / Project ID", "difference between Development and Production", "Catalyst project structure", "catalyst.json explained", `catalyst init`, `catalyst deploy`, `catalyst serve`, `catalyst login`, "how do I set up Catalyst with Claude", "how do I use Catalyst in Cursor", "how do I use Catalyst with GitHub Copilot", "which service should I use", "what Catalyst service for X", or any question about Catalyst IDs, environments, organizations, IDE setup, architecture decisions, or CLI subcommands.

## 🔌 MCP Connection Check (Do This Before Anything Else)

**Before reading `.catalystrc`, asking the user for IDs, or doing anything project-related — check whether Zoho MCP tools are available in your tool list.**

Look for tools prefixed with `CatalystbyZoho_` (e.g., `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Projects`, `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Tables`).

**If MCP tools ARE available:**
- Use `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Organizations` to get the org ID
- Use `CatalystbyZoho_List_All_Projects` to get the project ID
- Use MCP tools to fetch table names, bucket names, ZAIDs, and all other project details directly — do NOT ask the user to copy-paste IDs from the console

**If MCP tools are NOT available:**
- Prompt the user to connect Zoho MCP before proceeding
- Guide them to: **VS Code → Settings → MCP** (or Claude Desktop `claude_desktop_config.json`) and add the Catalyst MCP server
- Fall back to reading `.catalystrc` and `catalyst.json` from the local project directory only as a last resort

> **Never ask the user to manually look up IDs from the console** if MCP is connected. Every project detail — org ID, project ID, table IDs, ZAIDs, bucket names — is retrievable via MCP tools. Asking the user to hunt for IDs when MCP is available wastes time and introduces copy-paste errors.
